/**
 * Implements the S88 bus protocol for reporting the state of tracks.
 * S88 is basically a long shift register where each bit corresponds
 * to a single contact on the track. Flip-flops on each S88 board make
 * sure activations are stored, so it is not necessary to query a
 * contact at the exact time it is activated. This implementation
 * allows a maximum of 512 bits or 32 full-width (16 bit) S88 boards.
 * The S88 standard recommends a maximum of 30 boards, so we should be
 * on the safe side.
